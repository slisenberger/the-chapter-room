Phi Psi Centralization Project
------------------------------
The Psi Psi Centralization Project is a project to create a universal website application for aspects of fraternity life that would be useful to automate, particularly parts relevant to its operational success.

Only active brothers in the house get access to the application.

Current planned modules include:

Guestlist/Party Logistics Manager: includes security shifts/social calendar.
Calendar: including dish schedule, social calendar, rush events
